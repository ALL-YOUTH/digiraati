# Digiraati

Digiraati is a open source (MIT license) "Virtual Council" software developed at Tampere University as a part of ALL-YOUTH -project. ALL-YOUTH itself is funded by Strategic Research Council (SRC) under the Academy of Finland. The package in this repository is a working early prototype of Ministry of Justice's current Digiraati -service which has, however, a different codebase.
